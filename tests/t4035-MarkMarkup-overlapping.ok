<p> The new 1<2<3<Mark>3>22<Mark>2up>1.vim plugin
    is a 21<great>21 companion to the 6<popular>6 <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2666" class="external">2<3<Mark>3>2.vim plugin</a>.
    With it, you can render the 13<h16<igh>1614<15<l16<igh>16t>15ing>14s>13 as 7<HTML>7 (or any other 7<markup>7),
    and therefore "export" them into a commonplace 7<format>7.
    This paragraph has been marked with the following 13<h16<igh>1614<15<l16<igh>16t>15ing>14s>13 (which
    have been extracted via <tt>:2<3<Mark>3>2YankDefinitions</tt>):
